# Add yourself some shortcuts to projects you often work on
# Example:
#
# brainstormr=/Users/robbyrussell/Projects/development/planetargon/brainstormr
#

## from https://github.com/schneems/explain_shell
function explain {
  # base url with first command already injected
  # $ explain tar
  #   => http://explainshel.com/explain/tar?args=
  url="http://explainshell.com/explain/$1?args="

  # removes $1 (tar) from arguments ($@)
  shift;

  # iterates over remaining args and adds builds the rest of the url
  for i in "$@"; do
    url=$url"$i""+"
  done

  # opens url in browser
  open $url
}
